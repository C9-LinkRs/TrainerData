# TrainerData
A little program that save trainer's data with OOP.
This is a little program that i had to do in OOP's class,it's consists in a program that save personal data about players, them, it's auto generate matches as you like and aswers the following questions:
1- What's the player that played more time in all the matches of the season (or the matches that you made it)
2- What's the player that had more goals in all the matches of the season (or the matches that you made it)
PD: The program auto generate matches and auto generate stats for the player of the matches
I will improve the program.
