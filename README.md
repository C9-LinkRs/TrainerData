# TrainerData
A little program that save trainer's data with OOP
This is a little program that i have to do in OOP's class,it's consists in a program that save personal data about players, them, it's auto generate matches as you like and aswers the following questions:
1- What's the player that played more time in all the matches of the season (or the matches that you made it)
2- What's the player that had more goals in all the matches of the season (or the matches that you made it)

I will improve the program.
